Preparation:

0. Assumes you have node.js properly installed on your system. (see https://nodejs.org/ )
1. Install the node.js files to a project directory  (ex: C:\Users\Mark\Node1)
2. Open a command window and proceed to the install directory from above.
3. Start up the main node.js application.  (ex: node app.js)

Test 1: InVision Challenge Test

1. This test will automatically run upon startup.  It can also be started and run manually using two separate
    internet browsers.  Three servers will fire up, one consumer and two producers.
    The consumer server starts up on port 8282 and the two producer servers fire on 8181 and 8182.  Each server
    output is logged to the console in on your command window and can be piped anywhere you want from the
    command line.  The test will run for approximately ten seconds and will log the consumer successfully
    processing requests from both producers concurrently at a steady rate of 2 rec/sec for a total of 4 rec/sec.
    The number of producers and the rate of activity can be easily controlled by setting manual variables
    with in the code.  This can be easily moved to some sort of config file later if desired.  Each producer and
    consumer will log its own messages upon generating and receiving data.  All messages are logged to the console.
    As stated above, this test can be easily re-run by stopping the server via cntl-C and restarting the main
    application as described above.  In addition , this test can also be manually run , as described above, by
    using two separate internet browsers.  To accomplish this, simply startup each internet browser and enter the
    urls of http://localhost:8181/starttest for one browswer and the other, http://localhost:8182/starttest.  Be
    sure to startup both browswers with in a few seconds of each other to produce desired results.  After the test
    is complete, the browser will report "starttest complete".

Test 2: Producer Server Test

1. To start this test, open your internet browser and enter the url of http://localhost:8181/start.  This will return
    a random math addition expression like "19+82=".  The random numbers are positive integers ranging from 1 to 100.
2. The same test can be achieved by using the url of http://localhost:8181/.  In addition, you can use port 8182 to
    achieve similar results with the second producer server.  All other urls should respond with a 404 error.

Test 3: Consumer Server Test

1. To start this test, open your internet browswer and enter the url of http://localhost:8282/compute?expr=42%2B43%3D.
    This will return the value of 85.  The consumer can also add any number of positive integers within normal
    ranges and return a result.  Be sure to encode you url information for other testing.
2. The same test can be achieved by using the url of http://localhost:8282/?expr=42%2B43%3D.  All other urls should
    respond with a 404 error, or a 400 error.
